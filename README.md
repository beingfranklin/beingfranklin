Hey there, I'm **Franklin**!

I'm working for [Sainsbury's](https://github.com/sainsburys-tech) in London. I did my CS Master's from [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/) When I'm not coding for work, I'm helping out with ~~Mozilla Kerala~~ and diving into open source projects.

ðŸ›  Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

   - Typescript
   - Node.js
   - React.js
   - Next.js
   - Laravel
   - Vue.js

Always up for a chat about all things tech. Reach out! ðŸ’¡
