Hey there, I'm **Franklin**!

I am a software engineer with a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science and a background in Data Engineering, focusing on product and design. My current tech stack includes Node.js, React.js, and a range of AWS services, but I am always eager to learn and work with any technology stack.

I love building web apps, integrations, platforms, and APIs. I am passionate about creating data-driven projects with great user experiences.

Feel free to reach out or just say hi! ðŸ‘‹
